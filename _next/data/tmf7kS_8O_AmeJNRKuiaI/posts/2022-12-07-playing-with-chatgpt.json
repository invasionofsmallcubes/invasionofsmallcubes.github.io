{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"2022-12-07-playing-with-chatgpt","c":"\nThis deserves my 2 years iatus from posting.\n\nI wanted to try and see what I could do with chatGPT. This took some time as too many people are using it so I had to retry some of the questions.\n\n> *I would like to write code in Java. I would like to write a method that receive in input a url as string and a tag, also as string. It should return \"https://short.url\" + tag\n\nFor example if I put in input \"https://google.com\" and \"gog\" it should return \"https://short.url/gog\".*\n\nHere's one way you could write this method in Java:\n\n~~~ java\npublic String createShortUrl(String url, String tag) {\n    return \"https://short.url/\" + tag;\n}\n~~~\n\nHere's an example of how you could call this method:\n\n~~~ java\nString shortUrl = createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\");\n~~~\n\nThis would set the shortUrl variable to the string \"https://short.url/gog\".\n\n> *Thanks. Can you please add tests for the method createShortUrl?*\n\nSure, here's an example of how you could write some tests for the createShortUrl method:\n\n~~~ java\npublic void testCreateShortUrl() {\n    // Test the createShortUrl method with a variety of inputs\n    assertEquals(\"https://short.url/gog\", createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\"));\n    assertEquals(\"https://short.url/abc123\", createShortUrl(\"https://example.com\", \"abc123\"));\n    assertEquals(\"https://short.url/xyz\", createShortUrl(\"https://test.com\", \"xyz\"));\n}\n~~~\n\nThis test method uses the `assertEquals` method to check that the `createShortUrl` method returns the expected result for a variety of inputs. If the method doesn't return the expected result, then the `assertEquals` method will throw an exception and the test will fail.\n\n> *Now I would like to add a second method that given a tag, retrieves the original url. So, for example, if I send in input \"gog\" I would get back \"https://www.google.com\"*\n\nHere's one way you could write a method that retrieves the original URL based on the tag:\n\n~~~ java\npublic String getOriginalUrl(String tag) {\n    // TODO: Implement a way to store and retrieve URLs based on the tag\n\n    // For now, just return a dummy URL\n    return \"https://www.google.com\";\n}\n~~~\n\nThis method currently just returns a dummy URL (`\"https://www.google.com\"`) for any input tag. In order to make this method actually retrieve the original URL based on the tag, you would need to implement some way to store and retrieve URLs based on their tags.\n\nHere's an example of how you could call the `getOriginalUrl` method:\n\n~~~ java\nString originalUrl = getOriginalUrl(\"gog\");\n~~~\n\nThis would set the `originalUrl` variable to the string `\"https://www.google.com\"`.\n\nYou could also write some tests for the `getOriginalUrl` method to ensure that it behaves as expected:\n\n~~~ java\npublic void testGetOriginalUrl() {\n    // Test the getOriginalUrl method with a variety of inputs\n    assertEquals(\"https://www.google.com\", getOriginalUrl(\"gog\"));\n    assertEquals(\"https://www.example.com\", getOriginalUrl(\"abc123\"));\n    assertEquals(\"https://www.test.com\", getOriginalUrl(\"xyz\"));\n}\n~~~\n\nThese tests use the `assertEquals` method to check that the `getOriginalUrl` method returns the expected result for a variety of inputs. If the method doesn't return the expected result, then the `assertEquals` method will throw an exception and the test will fail.\n\n> *Can you put both methods in one class?*\n\nSure, here's how you could put both of the methods in a single Java class:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class UrlShortener {\n    public String createShortUrl(String url, String tag) {\n        return \"https://short.url/\" + tag;\n    }\n\n    public String getOriginalUrl(String tag) {\n        // TODO: Implement a way to store and retrieve URLs based on the tag\n\n        // For now, just return a dummy URL\n        return \"https://www.google.com\";\n    }\n\n    public void testCreateShortUrl() {\n        // Test the createShortUrl method with a variety of inputs\n        assertEquals(\"https://short.url/gog\", createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://short.url/abc123\", createShortUrl(\"https://example.com\", \"abc123\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://short.url/xyz\", createShortUrl(\"https://test.com\", \"xyz\"));\n    }\n\n    public void testGetOriginalUrl() {\n        // Test the getOriginalUrl method with a variety of inputs\n        assertEquals(\"https://www.google.com\", getOriginalUrl(\"gog\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://www.example.com\", getOriginalUrl(\"abc123\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://www.test.com\", getOriginalUrl(\"xyz\"));\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nThis class defines two methods, `createShortUrl` and `getOriginalUrl`, as well as two test methods, `testCreateShortUrl` and `testGetOriginalUrl`. You could use this class in your Java code by creating an instance of the `UrlShortener` class and calling the methods on that instance. For example:\n\n~~~ java\nUrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener();\nString shortUrl = shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\");\nString originalUrl = shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"gog\");\n~~~\n\nYou could also run the test methods by calling them on an instance of the `UrlShortener` class:\n\n~~~ java\nUrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener();\nshortener.testCreateShortUrl();\nshortener.testGetOriginalUrl();\n~~~\n\nThis would run both of the test methods and check that the `createShortUrl` and `getOriginalUrl` methods behave as expected.\n\n> *The tests don't need to be included in the class*\n\nYou're right, the tests don't need to be included in the `UrlShortener` class. Instead, you could create a separate test class that tests the  `UrlShortener` class. Here's an example of how you could do that:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class UrlShortenerTest {\n    public void testCreateShortUrl() {\n        UrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener();\n\n        // Test the createShortUrl method with a variety of inputs\n        assertEquals(\"https://short.url/gog\", shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://short.url/abc123\", shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://example.com\", \"abc123\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://short.url/xyz\", shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://test.com\", \"xyz\"));\n    }\n\n    public void testGetOriginalUrl() {\n        UrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener();\n\n        // Test the getOriginalUrl method with a variety of inputs\n        assertEquals(\"https://www.google.com\", shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"gog\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://www.example.com\", shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"abc123\"));\n        assertEquals(\"https://www.test.com\", shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"xyz\"));\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nThis test class defines two test methods, `testCreateShortUrl` and `testGetOriginalUrl`, that test the `createShortUrl` and `getOriginalUrl` methods of the `UrlShortener` class. To run these tests, you could create an instance of the `UrlShortenerTest` class and call the test methods on that instance. For example:\n\n~~~ java\nUrlShortenerTest tests = new UrlShortenerTest();\ntests.testCreateShortUrl();\ntests.testGetOriginalUrl();\n~~~\n\nThis would run both of the test methods and check that the createShortUrl and `getOriginalUrl` methods behave as expected.\n\n> *Can you please now implement a way to store and retrieve URLs based on the tag?*\n\nSure, here's one way you could implement a way to store and retrieve URLs based on their tags:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class UrlShortener {\n    private Map<String, String> urlMap;\n\n    public UrlShortener() {\n        urlMap = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public String createShortUrl(String url, String tag) {\n        // Store the URL and tag in the map\n        urlMap.put(tag, url);\n\n        return \"https://short.url/\" + tag;\n    }\n\n    public String getOriginalUrl(String tag) {\n        // Retrieve the URL from the map based on the tag\n        return urlMap.get(tag);\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nThis implementation uses a `HashMap` to store the URLs and their associated tags. When the `createShortUrl` method is called, it stores the URL and tag in the map. When the `getOriginalUrl` method is called, it retrieves the URL from the map based on the tag.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this `UrlShortener` class:\n\n~~~ java\nUrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener();\n\n// Create a short URL\nString shortUrl = shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\");\n\n// Retrieve the original URL\nString originalUrl = shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"gog\");\n~~~\n\nThis code creates a short URL using the `createShortUrl` method, and then retrieves the original URL using the `getOriginalUrl` method. The urlMap field is used to store the URLs and their associated tags, and allows the `getOriginalUrl` method to retrieve the original URL based on the tag.\n\n> *Can you convert UrlShortener in golang?*\n\nSure, here's how you could write a `UrlShortener` class in Go:\n\n~~~ go\ntype UrlShortener struct {\n    urlMap map[string]string\n}\n\nfunc (shortener *UrlShortener) CreateShortUrl(url string, tag string) string {\n    // Store the URL and tag in the map\n    shortener.urlMap[tag] = url\n\n    return \"https://short.url/\" + tag\n}\n\nfunc (shortener *UrlShortener) GetOriginalUrl(tag string) string {\n    // Retrieve the URL from the map based on the tag\n    return shortener.urlMap[tag]\n}\n\nfunc NewUrlShortener() *UrlShortener {\n    return &UrlShortener{\n        urlMap: make(map[string]string),\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nThis implementation is similar to the Java implementation, but uses Go's built-in map type instead of a `HashMap` to store the URLs and their associated tags. The `CreateShortUrl` method stores the URL and tag in the map, and the `GetOriginalUrl` method retrieves the URL from the map based on the tag. The `NewUrlShortener` function is a constructor that creates a new `UrlShortener` instance and initializes the `urlMap` field.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this `UrlShortener` class in Go:\n\n~~~ go\nshortener := NewUrlShortener()\n\n// Create a short URL\nshortUrl := shortener.CreateShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\")\n\n// Retrieve the original URL\noriginalUrl := shortener.GetOriginalUrl(\"gog\")\n~~~\n\nThis code creates a new `UrlShortener` instance using the `NewUrlShortener` constructor, creates a short URL using the `CreateShortUrl` method, and then retrieves the original URL using the `GetOriginalUrl` method. The urlMap field is used to store the URLs and their associated tags, and allows the `GetOriginalUrl` method to retrieve the original URL based on the tag.\n\n> *Let's go back to the `UrlShortener` in Java. Can you extract the map in a class called `Database` and add methods to add and recover the data from the map.*\n\nSure, here's how you could extract the `urlMap` field into a separate Database class in Java:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class UrlShortener {\n    private Database database;\n\n    public UrlShortener() {\n        database = new Database();\n    }\n\n    public String createShortUrl(String url, String tag) {\n        // Store the URL and tag in the database\n        database.addUrl(tag, url);\n\n        return \"https://short.url/\" + tag;\n    }\n\n    public String getOriginalUrl(String tag) {\n        // Retrieve the URL from the database based on the tag\n        return database.getUrl(tag);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Database {\n    private Map<String, String> urlMap;\n\n    public Database() {\n        urlMap = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addUrl(String tag, String url) {\n        urlMap.put(tag, url);\n    }\n\n    public String getUrl(String tag) {\n        return urlMap.get(tag);\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nThe `UrlShortener` class now uses a `Database` instance to store and retrieve URLs based on their tags. The `Database` class defines a `urlMap` field that uses a `HashMap` to store the URLs and their associated tags. The `addUrl` and `getUrl` methods allow the `UrlShortener` class to store and retrieve URLs from the `urlMap` field.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use these classes in your Java code:\n\n~~~ java\nUrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener();\n\n// Create a short URL\nString shortUrl = shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\");\n\n// Retrieve the original URL\nString originalUrl = shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"gog\");\n~~~\n\nThis code creates a new `UrlShortener` instance, creates a short URL using the `createShortUrl` method, and then retrieves the original URL using the `getOriginalUrl` method. The `urlMap` field in the `Database` class is used to store the URLs and their associated tags, and allows the `getOriginalUrl` method to retrieve the original URL based on the tag.\n\n> *Can you please implement dependency injection between UrlShortener and Database?*\n\nSure, here's how you could use dependency injection to provide a Database instance to the UrlShortener class in Java:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class UrlShortener {\n    private Database database;\n\n    public UrlShortener(Database database) {\n        this.database = database;\n    }\n\n    public String createShortUrl(String url, String tag) {\n        // Store the URL and tag in the database\n        database.addUrl(tag, url);\n\n        return \"https://short.url/\" + tag;\n    }\n\n    public String getOriginalUrl(String tag) {\n        // Retrieve the URL from the database based on the tag\n        return database.getUrl(tag);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Database {\n    private Map<String, String> urlMap;\n\n    public Database() {\n        urlMap = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    public void addUrl(String tag, String url) {\n        urlMap.put(tag, url);\n    }\n\n    public String getUrl(String tag) {\n        return urlMap.get(tag);\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nIn this implementation, the `UrlShortener` class now has a constructor that takes a `Database` instance as an argument. This allows the caller of the `UrlShortener` class to provide a specific `Database` instance to be used by the `UrlShortener` class.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use these classes with dependency injection in your Java code:\n\n~~~ java\n// Create a Database instance\nDatabase database = new Database();\n\n// Create a UrlShortener instance and inject the Database instance\nUrlShortener shortener = new UrlShortener(database);\n\n// Create a short URL\nString shortUrl = shortener.createShortUrl(\"https://google.com\", \"gog\");\n\n// Retrieve the original URL\nString originalUrl = shortener.getOriginalUrl(\"gog\");\n~~~\n\nIn this code, a new `Database` instance is created and then used to create a new `UrlShortener` instance. The `UrlShortener` instance uses the injected `Database` instance to store and retrieve URLs based on their tags. This allows the caller of the `UrlShortener` class to provide a specific `Database` implementation to be used by the `UrlShortener` class.\n\n> *Can you extract an interface from Database?*\n\nSure, here's how you could extract an interface from the `Database` class in Java:\n\n~~~ java\npublic interface Database {\n    void addUrl(String tag, String url);\n    String getUrl(String tag);\n}\n\npublic class HashMapDatabase implements Database {\n    private Map<String, String> urlMap;\n\n    public HashMapDatabase() {\n        urlMap = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void addUrl(String tag, String url) {\n        urlMap.put(tag, url);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getUrl(String tag) {\n        return urlMap.get(tag);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class UrlShortener {\n    private Database database;\n\n    public UrlShortener(Database database) {\n        this.database = database;\n    }\n\n    public String createShortUrl(String url, String tag) {\n        // Store the URL and tag in the database\n        database.addUrl(tag, url);\n\n        return \"https://short.url/\" + tag;\n    }\n\n    public String getOriginalUrl(String tag) {\n        // Retrieve the URL from the database based on the tag\n        return database.getUrl(tag);\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nIn this implementation, the `Database` interface defines the `addUrl` and `getUrl` methods that are used by the `UrlShortener` class. The `HashMapDatabase` class implements the `Database` interface and uses a `HashMap` to store the URLs and their associated tags. The `UrlShortener` class now uses the `Database` interface instead of the `HashMapDatabase` class directly, which allows the caller of the `UrlShortener` class to provide any implementation of the `Database` ...\n\n> *Can you please add another implementation of Database that connects to a mysql database using a connection pool?*\n\nSure, here's how you could implement a `Database` class that connects to a MySQL database using a connection pool in Java:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class MysqlDatabase implements Database {\n    private ConnectionPool pool;\n\n    public MysqlDatabase(ConnectionPool pool) {\n        this.pool = pool;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void addUrl(String tag, String url) {\n        try (Connection conn = pool.getConnection()) {\n            // Create the SQL query\n            String query = \"INSERT INTO url_table (tag, url) VALUES (?, ?)\";\n\n            // Create a PreparedStatement\n            PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\n\n            // Set the values of the parameters in the PreparedStatement\n            stmt.setString(1, tag);\n            stmt.setString(2, url);\n\n            // Execute the query\n            stmt.executeUpdate();\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getUrl(String tag) {\n        try (Connection conn = pool.getConnection()) {\n            // Create the SQL query\n            String query = \"SELECT url FROM url_table WHERE tag = ?\";\n\n            // Create a PreparedStatement\n            PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\n\n            // Set the value of the parameter in the PreparedStatement\n            stmt.setString(1, tag);\n\n            // Execute the query\n            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n~~~\n\n> *Can you give me an example of how to initialise a connection pool to be used in the MysqlDatabase?*\n\nSure, here's an example of how you could initialize a connection pool to be used by the MysqlDatabase class in Java:\n\n~~~ java\n// Create a HikariConfig instance\nHikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();\n\n// Set the JDBC URL\nconfig.setJdbcUrl(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/url_shortener\");\n\n// Set the username and password\nconfig.setUsername(\"user\");\nconfig.setPassword(\"password\");\n\n// Create a HikariDataSource instance using the HikariConfig instance\nDataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);\n\n// Create a ConnectionPool instance using the HikariDataSource instance\nConnectionPool pool = new HikariConnectionPool(dataSource);\n\n// Create a MysqlDatabase instance using the ConnectionPool instance\nDatabase database = new MysqlDatabase(pool);\n~~~\n\nIn this code, a `HikariConfig` instance is used to configure the JDBC URL, username, and password for the MySQL database. The `HikariConfig` instance is then used to create a `HikariDataSource` instance, which is used to create a `ConnectionPool` instance. Finally, the `ConnectionPool` instance is used to create a `MysqlDatabase` instance.\n\nThis `ConnectionPool` instance can then be used by the `MysqlDatabase` class to connect to the MySQL database and store and retrieve URLs based on their tags.\n\nNote that this code uses the `HikariCP` library to create the connection pool. You would need to add the HikariCP dependency to your project in order to use this code. You can find more information about `HikariCP`, including installation instructions, on the `HikariCP` website: <https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/>\n\n> *Can you reprint MysqlDatabase here removing all comments and empty lines in the source code?*\n\nSure, here's the `MysqlDatabase` class without comments or empty lines:\n\n~~~ java\npublic class MysqlDatabase implements Database {\n    private ConnectionPool pool;\n\n    public MysqlDatabase(ConnectionPool pool) {\n        this.pool = pool;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void addUrl(String tag, String url) {\n        try (Connection conn = pool.getConnection()) {\n            String query = \"INSERT INTO url_table (tag, url) VALUES (?, ?)\";\n            PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\n            stmt.setString(1, tag);\n            stmt.setString(2, url);\n            stmt.executeUpdate();\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getUrl(String tag) {\n        try (Connection conn = pool.getConnection()) {\n            String query = \"SELECT url FROM url_table WHERE tag = ?\";\n            PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);\n            stmt.setString(1, tag);\n            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n\n            if (rs.next()) {\n                return rs.getString(\"url\");\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n~~~\n\nThis implementation of the `MysqlDatabase` class is similar to the previous implementation, but without comments or empty lines. It uses a `ConnectionPool` instance to connect to a MySQL database and store and retrieve URLs based on their tags. It uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks and to improve performance by allowing the database server to cache and reuse the executed query.\n\nNote that this code uses the `HikariCP` library to create the connection pool. You would need to add the `HikariCP` dependency to your project in order to use this code. You can find more information about `HikariCP`, including installation instructions, on the `HikariCP` website: <https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChatGPT is an impressive language model trained by OpenAI that is able to generate code based on natural language prompts. It is able to write a good amount of code in various programming languages, including Java, Go, Python, and more.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of ChatGPT is its ability to understand complex programming concepts and generate code that is syntactically and semantically correct. It is able to generate code that follows the correct syntax and structure of the chosen programming language, and can even generate code that uses advanced language features and libraries.\n\nHowever, despite its impressive ability to generate code, ChatGPT still requires supervision and review by a human programmer. While it is able to generate correct code most of the time, it is not perfect and can make mistakes. For example, it may generate code that does not compile, or that has logical errors or bugs.\n\nOne of the reasons for these errors is that ChatGPT does not learn from its mistakes. Unlike a human programmer, who can learn from their mistakes and improve their skills over time, ChatGPT is a machine learning model that does not have the ability to learn from its mistakes. As a result, it may generate the same error multiple times, even if it has been corrected previously.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT is an impressive language model that is able to generate code based on natural language prompts. It is able to generate code that is syntactically and semantically correct, and can even handle advanced language features and libraries. However, it still requires supervision and review by a human programmer, as it is not perfect and can make mistakes. Additionally, it does not learn from its mistakes, which can lead to repeated errors.\n\nPS: the conclusion was generated by chatGPT as well based on the input\n\n> *Write an essay on how chatGPT is impressive because it's able to write a good amount of code but it still needs supervision because of some errors. Also it should tell about the fact it seems it doesn't learn from mistakes and sometimes it does the same errors.*\n","title":"Playing with chatGPT","date":"2022-12-07"}},"__N_SSG":true}
