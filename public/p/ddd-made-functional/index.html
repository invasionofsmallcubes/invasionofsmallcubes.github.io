# Domain Modeling Made Functional 
## by Scott Wlaschin
Book Report

.foornote[by [Emanuele Ianni](https://www.theinvasionofsmallcubes.com)]

class: middle

# The book in a slide
- the importance of having a <u>shared model</u> between devs, domain experts and stakeholders
- how to create a shared model with the strong type system of a functional programming language
- using domain driven design to describe and implement business events and processes
- implementation of a use case with F#

# Introduction to DDD (Shared model 3/4)
- What if the domain experts, the development
team, other stakeholders, and (most importantly) the source code itself all
share the same model?

.center-img3[![Lean Requirements](shared_model.png)]

class: middle

# Introduction to DDD (Shared model 4/4)
- _Faster time to market._ When the developer and the codebase share the
same model as the person who has the problem, the team is more likely
to develop an appropriate solution quickly.
- _More business value._ A solution that is accurately aligned with the problem
means happier customers and less chance of going offtrack.
- _Less waste._ Clearer requirements means less time wasted in misunderstanding
and rework.
- _Easier maintenance and evolution._ When the model expressed by the code
closely matches the domain expert’s own model, making changes to the
code is easier and less error-prone.

---
class: middle

# How do we create a shared model?
- Focus on business events and workflows rather than data structures.
- Partition the problem domain into smaller subdomains.
- Create a model of each subdomain in the solution.
- Develop a common language (known as the “Ubiquitous Language”) that
is shared between everyone involved in the project and is used everywhere
in the code.

# Bounded context
- the subdomains are called <u>bounded context</u> in DDD
- it's a <u>context</u> because each context represents some specialized knowledge
in the solution
- it's <u>bounded</u> meaning that there is a clear separation of concerns between context and we can use software engineering best practices to keep decoupling and allow independent evolution

# DDD recap (1/2)

- A <u>Domain</u> is an area of knowledge associated with the problem we are
trying to solve.
- A <u>Domain Model</u> is a set of simplifications that represent those aspects of
a domain that are relevant to a particular problem.
- The <u>Ubiquitous Language</u> is a set of concepts and vocabulary that is
associated with the domain and is shared by both the team members and
the source code.
- A <u>Bounded Context</u> is a subsystem in the solution space with clear
boundaries that distinguish it from other subsystems. A bounded context
often corresponds to a subdomain in the problem space.

---
class: middle

# DDD recap (2/2)

- A <u>Context Map</u> is a high-level diagram showing a collection of bounded
contexts and the relationships between them.
- A <u>Domain Event</u> is a record of something that happened in the system.
It’s always described in the past tense. An event often triggers additional
activity.
- A <u>Command</u> is a request for some process to happen and is triggered by
a person or another event. If the process succeeds, the state of the system
changes and one or more Domain Events are recorded.

# Understanding the domain

- fight the impulse to do <u>Database-Driven Design</u>.
- fight the impulse to do <u>Class-Driven Design</u>.
- focus on documenting the domain with code.

# Architecture concepts

- A <u>Domain Object</u> is an object designed for use only within the boundaries
of a context, as opposed to a Data Transfer Object.
- A <u>Data Transfer Object</u>, or DTO, is an object designed to be serialized and
shared between contexts.
- An <u>Anti-Corruption Layer</u>, or ACL, is a component that translates concepts
from one domain to another in order to reduce coupling and allow domains
to evolve independently.
- <u>Persistence Ignorance</u> means that the domain model should be based only
on the concepts in the domain itself and should not contain any awareness
of databases or other persistence mechanisms.

# Other DDD concepts

- A **Value Object** is a domain object without identity. Two Value Objects containing
the same data are considered identical. Value Objects must be immutable. Examples of Value Objects
are names, addresses, locations, money, and dates.
- An **Entity** is a domain object that has an intrinsic identity that persists even as
its properties change. Entity objects generally have an ID or key field, and two
Entities with the same ID/key are considered to be the same object. Examples of Entities are customers, orders, products, and
invoices.
-  An **Aggregate** is a collection of related objects that are treated as a single component
both to ensure consistency in the domain and to be used as an atomic unit
in data transactions. Other Entities should only reference the aggregate by its
identifier, which is the ID of the “top-level” member of the aggregate, known as
the “root.”

  else Ok (UnitQuantity qty)

let value (UnitQuantity qty) = qty
~~~
<p class="unstyled">and we can use it this way:</p>
~~~fsharp
let unitQtyResult = UnitQuantity.create 1
match unitQtyResult with
  | Error msg -> printfn "Failure, Message is %s" msg
  | Ok uQty -> printfn "Success. Value is %A" uQty
~~~

# Type of Errors

- **Domain Errors.** These are errors that are to be expected as part of the
business process and therefore must be included in the design of the
domain, such as an order that is rejected by billing. The business will already have procedures
in place to deal with this kind of thing, and the code will need to reflect
these processes.
- **Panics.** These are errors that leave the system in an unknown state,
such as unhandleable system errors (such as “out of memory”) or errors
caused by programmer oversight (“divide by zero” or “null
reference”).
- **Infrastructure Errors.** These are errors that are to be expected as part of
the architecture but are not part of any business process and are not
included in the domain, such as a network timeout or an authentication
failure.

<p class="unstyled">Sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a domain error or not.</p>

unsure, just ask a domain expert!</p>

# Conclusion

- the DDD part, although is simplistic compared to other books, for example Eric Evans' books, it's good for someone starting with this topic
- many of the confusion parts about functional programming are explained really well with actual examples to implement the order domain (there is also a github repository if you want to explore the code)
- the book doesn't stop to theory but if you follow, you can implement from HTTP endpoint to persistence to a document db so everything is pretty practical
- I feel personally I clarified some of the aspect that usually remanins a little bit abstract when it comes to functional programming applied to real problems
- it's a buy 👍
