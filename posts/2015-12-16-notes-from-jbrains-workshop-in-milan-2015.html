thanks to the company I work for, lastminute.com.</p><p>Here you can find the notes I took during these two days.</p><p>The workshop was composed by programming sessions, Q&amp;A sessions and TDD sessions
where JBrains explained how to do Evolutionary Design
(which is a really cool name for what I do every day, instead of TDD).</p><p><em>Here&#x27;s my notes (contact me on twitter if you see any error):</em></p><p>Ask about the interface to the customer.
Example: what happens if I don&#x27;t find the bar-code?</p><p>Book &quot;Getting things done!&quot;.</p><p>Get to the green bar as fast as you can.
Spend as much time as possible in the
green code-base. Write everything when
everything is in the green bar.</p><p>Reduce the margin cost of adding a new feature.
If we &quot;don&#x27;t clean the kitchen&quot; the margin cost
will go up like an exponential curve.</p><p>Ownership of responsibility. Code without error
is your responsibility as a programmer.</p><p>Usage of primitive obsession: usage of simple
types instead of complex objects.</p><p>Objective of refactoring is to make the next
task easy.</p><p>A feature is READY: somebody will be able to use this</p><p>Testing steps:</p><ul><li>Arrange (constructors, resources for the test)</li><li>Act (do the actual action)</li><li>Assert (check it&#x27;s working)</li></ul><p>Not more than one action per test.</p><p>Teams should not have different vision on code.
It&#x27;s a problem otherwise: a failure is &quot;keeping the marriage together for the kids&quot;.</p><p>The customer doesn&#x27;t know how many details
he needs to give you. Try to get an approximate
idea of what they want and then give back an implementation
to get a quick feedback. A that point you can talk
giving examples on what they need.</p><p>ALWAYS ask to the customer.</p><p>Check for signs that the design is going out of control.
Example: you test arithmetics checking strings.</p><p>Check for irrelevant lines, separate them and you
can see when you need to remove them from the class.</p><p>The link between the input and the expected output
must be clear.</p><p>Book &quot;Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations and Games&quot;.</p><p>The only problems we have when dealing with client-server are
the ones about not respecting the contract.
Example: I don&#x27;t pass you &quot;null&quot;.</p><p>In case of copy and paste code, use learning tests.
If I don&#x27;t have control of the design I don&#x27;t do TDD,
I can write learning to test to understand the
contract.</p><p>Test First programming to avoid mistakes!</p><p>If a test is difficult to write or we are testing something indirectly
then probably production code has problems.</p><p>Find a community of people with more experience than you,
they can give you advice when you have doubts on your code.</p><p>With TDD you can learn module design.</p><p>Agile works when you&#x27;re willing to change the plan.</p><p>Book &quot;The Goal&quot; about theory of constraints.</p><p>The 4 rules of simple design.
A simple design means:</p><ol><li><del>Passes its tests</del></li><li>Minimizes duplication</li><li>Maximizes clarity</li><li><del>Has fewer elements</del></li></ol><p>You just need those 2.</p><p>Developing strong skills on detecting duplication,
removing duplication, identifying naming problems,
and fixing naming problems equates to learning
everything ever written about object-oriented
design.</p><ul><li>Remove Duplication =&gt; Structure Emerges</li><li>Improve Names =&gt; Redistribute Responsibilities</li></ul><p>If the name has &quot;if, then, but, or, and&quot; then
something is wrong with the method. Also check for
something like: <em>displayResult(String barcode)</em> is something
that should let you think because it tells you that inside
you are finding the price associated to the barcode and
then displaying it.</p><p>The single most important thing a human can do is
abstraction. We need to treat a box like a single thing.</p><p>Improve names -&gt; Abstraction emerge -&gt;
Higher-level duplication -&gt; remove duplication -&gt;
structures emerge -&gt; structures need names
-&gt; go to &quot;Improve names&quot; and start again.</p><p>When it works STOP WRITING. Then go for removing
duplication and liability.</p><p>Egoless programming: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/">http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/</a></p><p>Don&#x27;t use static because it&#x27;s a strong dependency
in your code.</p><p>You need to move your classes from test to
production as soon someone needs it.</p><p>If you feel the need to format the code, just
format it then commit and then start working
otherwise diff will not be clear.</p><p>When you see a typo made by another team
member count to 15 before telling him.</p><p>Mistake proof: build the system so that the
components goes in one place in one way (I think).
