<p>After updating my MacBook Pro Late 2011 (yeah, that old and it still rocks hard!), I couldn&#x27;t find a way to let him write on the NTFS drive. I could mount it, I could read files, but no writing at all.</p>
<p>If you want to spend money, I had for a month the trial period for <a href="http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/">Tuxera NTFS</a> and that worked like a charm.</p>
<p>In my case though, I could not accept that an update could crash my Fuse OSX and NTFS-3g setup.</p>
<p>You can find a lot of gists around that have a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>I used this <a href="https://gist.github.com/Coeur/86a18b646a3b78930cf3">gist</a> but I keep getting problems.</p>
<p>First of all after reinstalling ntfs-3g with <code>brew</code> I got the program broken (I don&#x27;t know how) and I had to relink it again with this command: <code>brew link --overwrite  homebrew/fuse/ntfs-3g</code>.</p>
<p>Then I could see the external drive anymore. <code>diskutil</code> was not able to mount it anymore but no message was shown. After some digging I tried to mount it via command line with <code>mount</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>diskutil list #to get the list of drives
sudo /sbin/mount_ntfs -o rw /dev/disk2s1 ~/temp
</code></pre>
<p>and it was still failing. When you install ntfs-3g you have errors on <code>/var/log/mount-ntfs-3g.log</code>, mine was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$MFTMirr does not match $MFT (record 0).
Failed to mount &#x27;/dev/disk2s1&#x27;: Input/output error
NTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it&#x27;s a
SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows
then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very
important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate
it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.
/dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the &#x27;dmraid&#x27; documentation
for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently the hard drive had some problem. Luckily mine was fixable running this command: <code>sudo ntfsfix /dev/disk2s1</code></p>
<p>After that trying to mount it again was a successful operation and I could write again on my NTFS external drive.</p>
