It&#x27;s just a condensed guide but you won&#x27;t find anything new.</p>
<p>As you know <a href="https://github.com/octopress/octopress" title="Octopress Github Repository">octopress</a> is a ruby project with some peculiar dependency.
I&#x27;m not a ruby developer so I would like not to have that many things on my pc used only for that purpose.</p>
<p>Now, my intention is to use this image as a virtual machine where I can run octopress commands. And that&#x27;s not
how you usually use a docker image. It&#x27;s actually really different from the day to day usage but I&#x27;m not going
to argue about the fact that I&#x27;m not using it in the proper way: you&#x27;re right and Han shot first. That is not going
to change the fact that we had Episodes 1 2 and 3 and the same goes for how I use docker in this case.</p>
<p>(if you&#x27;re wondering about the fact that all this ranting was to make a Star Wars reference: right again :P )</p>
<p>When you create a new image you&#x27;ll describe the way it&#x27;s configured in a Dockerfile. Let&#x27;s see mine:</p>

<p>You can check official documentation to know how to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/">docker build</a> and what keys you can user in a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">Dockerfile</a>.</p>
<p>What I would like to stress about it here is just keep it readable because configuring a docker image could be really complex. You can use <code>ENV</code> to set up environment variables that you can use later with <code>$VARIABLE</code>.
Remember the difference between <code>RUN</code> and <code>CMD</code>. <code>RUN</code> is used with <code>docker build</code> whereas <code>CMD</code> is used when you use <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>In this particular case to build the image (that you can find on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/invasionofsmallcubes/octopress/">DockerHub</a> ) just run <code>docker build -t octopress .</code>.</p>
<p>To run it is a little bit trickier than usual but it&#x27;s doable: <code>docker run -p 4000:4000 -v /Users/dierre/Projects/octopress/:/octopress -i -t --entrypoint=&quot;/bin/bash&quot; invasionofsmallcubes/octropress</code>.</p>
<p>Here you <em>expose</em> the port 4000 that you will later use to check a preview of your blog, you&#x27;ll start your docker image opening a console and then you share the content of your octopress repository that in my case is in <em>/Users/dierre/Projects/octopress/</em>.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_six/">tag</a> a built image you can just follow the official documentation, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Last note: if you are using OSX then docker will start in a VirtualBox machine named <em>default</em> which has a specific address. You you want to see a preview of the blog, remember to run <code>jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0</code>, where the option <code>--host 0.0.0.0</code> is used to open jekyll to answer to every call from everywhere, because the default behaviour is just listen to 127.0.0.1 which is not a viable solution when using docker since you are using the host browser.</p>
<p>I hope it&#x27;s helpful.</p> </div></article></main><div class="layout_backToHome__9sjx_"><a href="/">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"2015-12-24-how-create-a-docker-image-and-publish-it-to-dockerhub","c":"This are my notes about how to configure a docker image and publish it on DockerHub.\nIt's just a condensed guide but you won't find anything new.\n\nAs you know [octopress][faef418d] is a ruby project with some peculiar dependency.\nI'm not a ruby developer so I would like not to have that many things on my pc used only for that purpose.\n\nNow, my intention is to use this image as a virtual machine where I can run octopress commands.
